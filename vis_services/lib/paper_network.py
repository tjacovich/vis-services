    '''
    Given a list of bibcodes, this function builds the papers network based on co-citations
    If 'weighted' is true, we will normalize the co-occurence frequency with the total number
    of papers in the set, otherwise we will work with the actual co-occurence frequencies.
    If 'equalization' is true, histogram equalization will be applied to the force values in
    the network

    Approach: given a reference dictionary {'paper1':['a','b','c',...], 'paper2':['b','c','g',...], ...}
              we contruct a matrix [[0,1,0,1,...], [0,0,1,...], ...] where every row corresponds with
              a paper in the original paper list and each column corresponds with the papers cited by these
              papers. The paper-citation matrix R is then the transpose of this matrix. The co-occurence
              (paper-paper) matrix is then R_t*R (with R_t the transpose of R). In case we scale with weights,
              represented by a weight matrix W, the scaled co-occurence matrix is R_t*(R-W). Later on we scale
              the force between nodes with a factor proportional to the inverse square root of the product
              of the number of references in the linked nodes.
